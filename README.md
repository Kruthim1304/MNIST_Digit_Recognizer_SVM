# MNIST_Digit_Recognizer_SVM
> We will develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem.

>We use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and the actual number between 0-9 is the label.
